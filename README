This is a collection of tarballs of C codes that I use a lot.
This is currently being packaged for me to play with Go and CGo.

The current list of packages :
  GSL
  FFTW
  LAPACK
  Scalapack 
  GlobalArrays

Note on BLAS/LAPACK :
  We build a reference version of BLAS for portability. However, the 
  idea is to be able to switch in a new version if available. That does require
  you to appropriately edit the CMakeLists.txt files in the external directory, 
  as well as to set the appropriate variables in init.sh
